/**
 * Cloudflare Worker entrypoint.
 *
 * The site itself is static. `next build` exports every page, image, icon,
 * robots.txt and sitemap.xml to `out/`, wrangler uploads that as Workers Static
 * Assets, and Cloudflare matches those before this Worker is invoked at all —
 * so a page view runs no code here, costs nothing against the 10 ms per-request
 * CPU budget, and does not count toward the 100k requests/day free-plan cap.
 *
 * What is left for this file is the part that genuinely cannot be static: the
 * /api/* handlers, which resolve a pasted link with a live extractor call.
 *
 * The handlers come from src/lib/apiRoutes.ts, written against plain
 * Request/Response. The App Router files under src/app/api/ wrap those same
 * functions, so `next dev` and any Node host exercise exactly this code — the
 * two paths cannot drift.
 *
 * Deliberately plain JavaScript, not TypeScript: tsconfig.json includes
 * `**\/*.ts`, and a `.ts` entrypoint here would be type-checked as part of the
 * app while actually targeting the workerd runtime.

 * There is deliberately no 404 handling here.

 * answer every unmatched path with out/404.html directly, without invoking this
 * Worker — verified against the deployment, including the vulnerability scans
 * (/wp-login.php, /.env, /vendor/…) that make up most of a public site's 404s.
 * Those used to be the single most expensive thing this Worker did, at up to
 * 116 ms of CPU each; they now cost none at all.
 *
 * `run_worker_first: ["/api/*"]` is what keeps API requests from being
 * swallowed by that same rule, and is the only reason this Worker is reachable.

/**
 * The one path the workers.dev hostname is allowed to serve.
 *
 * Cloudflare's Bot Fight Mode is a *zone* feature, so it challenges Creem's
 * webhook POSTs to the custom domain — they arrive from an AWS address with an
 * `axios` user agent, which is exactly what it is built to stop, and it offers
 * no per-path exception on the free plan. Every delivery came back as a
 * `managed_challenge` and never reached this Worker, which is why webhooks had
 * to be treated as unreliable and reconcile did all the real work.
 *
 * The workers.dev hostname is not in that zone, so it is not challenged. Creem
 * points at it instead. That is the whole reason it is load-bearing.
 *
 * But an origin that skips the zone's bot protection must not also be a second
 * front door to everything else: `/api/download` would be reachable with no
 * protection at all, and the entire static site would be served from a second
 * hostname as duplicate content. So this host serves the one endpoint that
 * verifies an HMAC over its own body before it trusts a single byte, and sends
 * everything else to the canonical origin.
